        This website was created as a simple alternative to speedrun.com
      </h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://speedrun.com">SRC</a> has become very annoying over the
        years. From bad user experience changes, to a costly membership that
        does absolutely nothing, to sketchy ads,
        <a href="https://elo.io">Elo</a>, the parent company, just doesn't seem
        to care about their website. For more information, check out
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ivLA9Uj1C8">this video</a> by
        Storster.

      >
        I created this website to view the leaderboards for a game simply, and
        effeciently
      </h2>
      <p>
        No more dealing with skecthy ads. No more dealing with a bad user
        experience. No more dealing with a monthly membership. I just wanted a
        way to quickly view the leaderboards, and here it is.
      </p>
      <h2 id="warning">WARNING</h2>
      <p>
        Please keep in mind that you can only view leaderboards. You CANNOT
        SUBMIT runs, VERIFY runs, or anything that has to do with the backend of
        SRC. This is a purely FRONTEND project.
      </p>
      <h2 id="limitations">LIMITATIONS</h2>
      <p>
        As of 2/12/23, you cannot filter runs other than by category (you cannot
        filter runs by date, whether a run has a video or not, you cannot see
        obsolete runs, etc.). You cannot view categories that have more than two
        different variables that are sub categories (e.g. Minecraft Any%
        Glitchless with set/random seed and different versions). This is only a
        small percentage of games however. I will try to implement fixes for
        these overtime. Please also keep in mind that I am still a dumb student
        and there will be glitches. Please be kind when reporting them.
